You've been presented with a piece of code enclosed between #!#!#! and !#!#!#. Your task as an expert coder is to enhance its readability and make it easier to work on. You should accomplish this by adding comments in places where names or definitions are unclear. If there are any functions that are referenced but not provided, feel free to ask for additional information about them. It's important to note that you should not make any changes to the code itself.
